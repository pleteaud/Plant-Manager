# Planto-Manager

## Description: 
This is an embedded project aimed at monitoring and caring for a potted plant. Device is able to monitor room temperature and humidity using the [DHT11](https://www.adafruit.com/product/386). It can also measure the soil moisture by utilizing a personally designed soil moisture sensor, influenced by [Grove's Capacitor Soil Moisture Sensor](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Capacitive_Moisture_Sensor-Corrosion-Resistant/). Additionally, the device is able to track time and set alarms using the [DS3231](https://components101.com/modules/ds3231-rtc-module-pinout-circuit-datasheet) RTC module. A [16x2 Character LCD](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/709)  was used to display relevant information. Lastly, given the simplicity of the tasks and the low cost, the firmware was developed on an Atmega328P.
